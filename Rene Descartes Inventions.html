    <p> The philosopher of method deprived science of the rigorousness of the scholastic method.
His project postulated a common general method in his rules for all sciences, according to which doubt is the best way to arrive at certainty.
The core of Descartes' rationalism is based on the fact that the structure of human reason is capable of being applied to the knowledge of all objects. That is the sustenance of all the sciences.</p>
    <p> The fundamental reference of the rational method was mathematics, this because only this science is able to give certain, obvious and exact demonstrations.
This is how he posed the decomposition of every complex problem in its simplest parts to arrive at a solution.
Then he made the mathematical method, the method of all real, the unifying principle of all sciences, the basis of every research process</p>

    <p>When Descartes formulated his Cartesian project of elaborating a universal science, based on mathematics as a paradigm, he created a kind of universal mathematics freed from numbers and figures: analytic geometry.</p>
    <p> This was a method that involved solving geometric problems algebraically and algebraic problems geometrically.
Cartesian geometry and exponential notation, invented by Descartes, is the algebraic system taught in schools in modern times. </p>

    <p> This is a postulate that distinguishes between mind, matter and God.
According to this theory, the body functions as a machine having divisible material properties and a mind (soul), indivisible substance that does not follow the laws of physics.</p>
    <p> Body and mind interact through the pineal gland. Thus dualism occurs: the mind controls the body and, in turn, it can influence the rational mind. Mind and matter are proofs of God's existence.
This is how the philosopher, based on his rationalism, establishes the metaphysical foundations that support the existence of God, the mind and the material world</p>
